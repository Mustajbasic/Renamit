# Renamit
A small console app for bulk renaming files

Placeholder instructions:
Just run ``node app`` and follow steps.

Make sure only the files you want to be renamed are in the path you provide to the app.
Files are sorted by date of creation and renamed (Oldest file gets index 1, next one 2 and so on...)
